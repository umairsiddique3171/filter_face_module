# filter_face_module
This repository contains the module source code I created, which takes the datapath of the images folder and iterates over all class subfolders to crop faces from images using the opencv haarcascades classifier for eyes and faces, then creates a new folder to save cropped face images on every respective class subfolder and also returns a dict with all classes as keys and their image filenames as values. It's useful while preprocessing data for facial recognition tasks as it makes face cropping totally automated.
